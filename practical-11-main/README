# Dependency Auditor and License Reporter

A custom tool designed to audit local `node_modules` for security and compliance purposes. It identifies all installed packages, analyzes their license status, and provides the foundation for full dependency graph and integrity checks.

## Goal

To create a tool that scans `node_modules`, computes integrity hashes (simulated), and builds a dependency graph with license detection.

## Task Fulfillment

| Goal | Method in `auditor.js` |
| :--- | :--- |
| Scans `node_modules` | Uses `fs.readdirSync` on the top-level `node_modules` directory. |
| Computes SHA-256 | **Stubbed:** Notes that the lockfile provides integrity hashes (SHA-512 or SHA1) for the tarball, which serves a similar purpose. Full file hashing is left as an advanced implementation step. |
| Builds dependency graph | The `traverseDependencies` function recursively resolves packages found in the `dependencies` fields of each `package.json`. |
| Reports missing licenses | Uses the `checkLicense` function to look for common license files and the `license` field, reporting those that are missing both. |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)

### Setup

1.  Make sure you are in the project root (`dependency-auditor`).
2.  Install some sample dependencies (this creates the `node_modules` folder needed for the script to run):
    ```bash
    npm install lodash express
    ```
3.  Execute the auditor script:
    ```bash
    node auditor.js
    ```

### Expected Output

The script will output a summary of packages found, a placeholder for the SHA-256 check, and a list of any packages where no license field or file could be detected.
